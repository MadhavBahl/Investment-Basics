# The "EV/Revenue" Ratio

EV: Enterprice Value

It is calculated as,

```
EV/Revenue = Enterprice Value/Revenue, where:

Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Debt - Cash and cash equivalents

Revenue = Total annual revenue
```

## When to use EV/Revenue Ratio

- This is commonly used for early-stage or high-growth businesses that do not have positive earnings yet.
- Alternative to ratios such as P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA

## Advantages of using EV/Revenue Ratio

- It is often beneficial when there are significant differences between accounting policies of the companies. PR ratio, on the other hand, can vary dramatically with changes in accounting policies.
- Often used for companies with negative free cash flows or unprofitable companies, for example, a tech startup.

## Disadvantages of using EV/Revenue Ratio

- Does not take into account the cost structure of the company (different types of expenses that a company incurs and is typically composed of fixed and variable costs).
- Ignores profitability and generation of cash flow.
- Hard to compare across different industries and different company phases (early-stage vs mature companies).

## What is a good EV/Revenue Ratio?

- Between 1.0-3.0 is good.
- Lower the number, it is better (undervalued).
