# The "EV/EBITDA" Ratio

**Formula:**

```
Enterprise Multiple = EV/EBITDA
```

where,

- EV = Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and cash equivalents
- EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization

Enterprise multiple can be used as an alternative or to supplement the P/E ratio.

## What is a good EV/EBITDA Ratio?

- Lower the number, the better.
- Less than 10.0 is considered good.
