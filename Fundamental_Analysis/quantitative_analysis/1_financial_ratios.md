# Key Financial Ratios

These are some quantitative measurements that can tell you about the growth story and current valuation of the company.

## Where do these ratios come from?

- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Cashflow statement

## Important points to note

- It's really important to compare these ratios within the industry vs outside the industry.
  - For example, a company might be doing good in broader market but within the specific industry it might not be the best choice.
  - Let's say a financial institution or a bank for some time might outperform a consumer goods company in a bull market, but that is not a good comparison as that same bank might not be doing good when compared to it's peers in the same industry, i.e., banking firms.
- Some ratios might be more important for one industry but not for the other.
  - For example, a high inventory turnover ratio might be good for a retail company but might not be as good for other institutions like software or banking
- Some ratios might be more important to some stock type than the other.
  - For example, a growth stock might have a different set of ratios to look at than a value stock.
  - Another example, dividend yield and payout ratio is good to compare within dividend stocks but might not be as good of an indicator in growth stocks
- There are hundreds of ratios, you should focus on key ones. (Over analysis might be as bad as under analysis)
