# Valuation Ratios

Valuation ratios try to answer one question - is the price of the stock justified?

- Is it a fair price?
- Is it really good? (Discount/Bargain)
- Is it over valued?

## Considerations

Higher stock price does not mean it's a better stock to buy today. Current high price does not promise profitability in future.

It's good to compare companies against competitors.

Some ratios may work better than others for certain companies. For example, P/E ratio is not good for companies with negative/no earnings (loss making companis).
